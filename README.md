This project is a web application built with Streamlit that integrates the OpenAI API and utilizes the Langchain library for managing conversational interactions. Users can input a search topic, and the application leverages OpenAI's natural language processing capabilities through Langchain's sequential chains. The conversational flow involves querying information about a person, including their name, date of birth, and major events related to a specific date. The results are displayed using Streamlit, with expandable panels providing additional details.
